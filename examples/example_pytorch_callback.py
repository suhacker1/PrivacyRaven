"""
PrivacyRaven has support for user-defined Pytorch Lightning Bolt callbacks which may be passed as arguments 
into the currently available attack functions.

A callback is just a function (or class in this case) that gets passed in as an argument to another
function, which should execute the callback function or class at some point during its runtime. 

Users should refer to https://pytorch-lightning-bolts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/callbacks.html to construct 
Pytorch Lightning Bolt callbacks.
